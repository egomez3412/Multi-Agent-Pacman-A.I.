CPSC 481 - Project 3

Pacman Games

Inspired by the original 1980 Pacman game, we created a python project that would simulate the Pacman player and the ghost. 
We developed an artificial intelligence program that would avoid multiple ghosts within the map by using A* and minimax search algorithms. 
Utilizing Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics were able to find a solution to the corners problem which assisted us in developing an A* algorithm in finding the best path in collecting all the foods in the Pacman game.
